## Description 
    
*The what, why, and how:* 
      
When creating an open source project on GitHub, it’s important to have a high-quality README for the app. This should include what the app is for, how to use the app, how to install it, how to report issues, and how to make contributions—this last part increases the likelihood that other developers will contribute to the success of the project.\
## Installation
  
npm install
## Usage 
  
When you run node index.js, the application uses the inquirer package to prompt you in the command line with a series of questions about your GitHub and about your project.
From there, the application will generate markdown and a table of contents for the README conditionally based on your responses to the Inquirer prompts (so, if you don't answer the optional questions, such as Installation, an Installation section will not be included in your README). The README will also include badges for the licenses.
## Test

  npm run test
